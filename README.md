SassRegulars
============

Sass Regulars is my own personal Sass framework, combining core components like reusable mixins and placeholders, and layout components that correspond to common HTML elements like images, navs, and typography.

Should you want to use this, do note that my mixins and placeholders require Sass v3.3. I will be creating a SassDocs-based documentation on it soon... I promise.
